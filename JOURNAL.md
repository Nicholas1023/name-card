## Finished the schematics

Today, I finished the schematics. It currently has a microcontroller unit on it, which I will program it to blink LEDs which are connected to its GPIO pins. It also has a ISP connector, which can be used to program the microcontroller. I faced issues selecting a appropriate MCU for the card. Some had too many GPIO pins while some does not have ISP.
