## Finished the schematics

Today, I finished the schematics. It currently has a microcontroller unit on it, which I will program it to blink LEDs which are connected to its GPIO pins. It also has a ISP connector, which can be used to program the microcontroller. I faced issues selecting a appropriate MCU for the card. Some had too many GPIO pins while some does not have ISP.

## Finished creating the PCB

Today, I added QR codes to my card and added wireless capabilities to it too. It has a MCU which would light 2 LEDs as output. I also faced issues calculating the appropriate values for generating the antenna.
